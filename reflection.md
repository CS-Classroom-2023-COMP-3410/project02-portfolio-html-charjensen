My development process was rather simple, I used ChatGPT to create placeholder html websites, and then edited what it gave me in order to finish the project. I have already worked with HTML files before, so there are a lot of challenges that I didn't need to go through. I think if this was my first time working with HTML, I would have definitely needed to figure out how page navigation works, how attributes work, and how HTML elements work. Other than that, the only challenge I faced was making the website look somewhat good (it still doesn't).
