            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Silent Hill 2 is, in my opinion, a master piece of psychological horror. The game is captivating in it's story, and never lets the player feel uneasy around every corner.
                But the beauty of Silent Hill is that it doesn't throw cheap jump scares and loud noises in your face, it cleverly uses sounds, players imaginations, and the narrative of the characters to drive its horror.
