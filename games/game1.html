            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I have been playing Counter-Strike for a decade now, and it never fails to capture my attention and sate my competitive drive. I love playing with my friends and in serious teams alike.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love This Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple but hard to master mechanics.</li>
                <li>An incredibly high skill ceiling that only few players are able to reach, meaning there is always something to strive for.</li>
                <li>An incredible community that tenaciously creates content and improves the game.</li>
            </ul>
